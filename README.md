## Execution and usage

To use this project, all you have to do is read what is on screen and figure it out along the way. You can look around the game by using the arrow keys
and you can answer the questions by just typing them.

+ Connor Pavicic - I am a 9th grade programmer who is trying to get by. Coding is really fun for me unless it is an assignment since I like coding when it is chill and relaxed and you can code at your own pace. Here are the places you can find me at: [GitHub]: (https://github.com/ConnorP4231) or email: connor.pavicic@ucas-edu.net
+ Evan McCabe - I am programming for a 9th grade programming class. Coding's pretty fun sometimes, but I didn't really like this class, and I'm more interested in art and animation, so I don't know if I'll be coding much in the future. I'm pretty awesome though, so feel free to contact me!
